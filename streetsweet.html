             <br><h5>Project</h5><br>
            <p>In recent years, Generation X’ers and Millenials have flocked to cities like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, particularly due to the growth of the tech industry. This clustering of young, trendy, work-minded individuals gave birth to another trend: food trucks. Having experienced convenience-based dining in San Francisco, and admittedly having a notable sweet tooth, I designed Street Sweet, an app that helps Food Truck lovers find and order from their favorite sweet-themed Food Trucks.</p>

    <div class="blue">
    <div class="container">
         <div class="row">
             <br><h5>My Role</h5><br>
            <p>I designed the Street Sweet app, produced user stories and flows, selected paired typefaces and a color palette, designed the logo, icon illustrations, wireframes and layouts, and produced a clickable prototype.</p>

             <br><h5>Goal</h5><br>
            <p>We’ve all been stuck in an office or classroom without enough time to go more than a few blocks during our lunch break. My goal was to design an app that enables food lovers to connect to their favorite nearby sweet-themed trucks, discover new trucks in their area, and order treats for pickup within the app.</p>
             
         
        </div> </div><br><a name="process"></a>

         <div class="row">
             <br><h5>Process</h5><br><h4>Discovery / Strategy</h4>
            <p>There are plenty of food trucks out there, but for some of us, there is only one way to snack: SWEET! After interviewing a few city-dwelling foodies and getting the scoop on the features they might like to see in apps, I narrowed the project focus to sweet-themed food trucks only, and began considering which features to include. Of course before I could do this, I had to decide if I was going to explore the consumer experience, the food truck owner experience, or both. I chose to focus solely the consumer side of how the app functions for this case study and design project.</p>
             <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
         <p>My focus group interviews helped me put together user personas. I wrote and prioritized user stories, which helped determine the features I would build out. The user flows I created from these stories allowed me to begin to determine how the navigation within the app might look, as well as further narrow down which features would be most useful.
</p>
             <div class="centered"><img class="centered" alt="user flows" src="images/streetsweet/userflows.png"><p class="centered caption">User Flows</p></div><br>
             <p>I did a potential user survey to gain more insight into the most useful features. One example was being able to add trucks to a “Favorites” list and locate those trucks on a map from that “Favorites” page. This feature became a much bigger priority after hearing survey feedback saying the feature would be very useful (many survey takers prioritized this feature over being able to write a review.)<br><br>

I developed low fidelity wireframes using MyBalsamiq with my prioritized features list and user flows in mind. I used these wireframes to create a clickable prototype using InVision so I could fill in the gaps in navigation when I moved on to high fidelity wireframes.
</p>
             <div class="centered"><img class="centered" alt="low fidelity wirefames" src="images/streetsweet/lowfi-wireframes.png"><p class="centered caption">Low Fidelity Wireframes</p><br><img class="centered" alt="high fidelity wirefames" src="images/streetsweet/highfi-wireframes.png"><p class="centered caption">High Fidelity Wireframes</p></div><br>
             <p>After user testing a high fidelity clickable prototype, I realized some more minute features weren’t as clear to first-time users as they could be. For example, after a user logs in, the first screen that loads is the map of their current location. But with users who had never seen the app before, this seemed like an error to them. <br><br>

I realized it would be wise to add a one-time popup to let new users know this is the right page to be on. I also made sure the option to confirm an order pickup was more clearly displayed as a banner above the menu bar throughout the app until clicked because users who didn’t perfectly follow the test instructions wound up astray and unable to find their way back to the Confirm Pick-Up page.
</p>
             <div class="centered"> <img alt="popups" src="images/streetsweet/popups.png"><p class="centered caption">Pop-Up and Banner</p></div><br>
             <h4>Visual Design</h4>
         <p>After doing sketches, I narrowed my designs to a food truck icon design with the name Street Sweet, or a “cupcake truck”.
</p>
             <div class="centered"><img alt="logo sketches" src="images/streetsweet/logosketches.png"><p class="centered caption">Logo Sketches, Logo Iterations</p></div><br>
             <p>After fleshing out both options in Illustrator, the cupcake truck was clearly the winner. I still planned to use my truck icon within the app though.
<br><br>
My color palette wound up including several cool greys instead of the deep maroon and mid-grey I initially chose. These changes were made as I worked on the HQ layouts and saw the colors in action, and after receiving survey feedback.
</p>
             <div class="centered"><img alt="style guide" src="images/streetsweet/styleguide.png"><p class="centered caption">Street Sweet Style Guide</p></div><br>
             <p>I chose typefaces at this point as well. Chewy was my final choice for headlines as it is a great combination of readable, playful, not overused, and still professional. Nunito was my final choice for smaller headlines and paragraphs because it has a friendly vibe while maintaining professionalism and is easy to read when scaled down (ideal for iOS design). I also designed custom icons for the menu bar that better suited the feeling of the app.<br><br>

While working on high quality screen designs, I decided on popup styles, button styles, and more. I wrote original copy and developed personas for the truck profile, reviews, etc. and developed a clickable prototype. User testing proved the changes included at the high fidelity mockup stage made the app easy to use from start to finish.</p>
             
             
             <div class="centered"><img alt="screenshots" src="images/streetsweet/hd-screenshots.png"><p class="centered caption">HD Screenshots</p></div><br>

    <div class="container">
         <div class="row">
             <br><h5>Results</h5><br>
            <p>Determining how Street Sweet would function and flow was a great exercise in navigation and functionality within an app. User testing proved to be an important part of the process as outside opinions were invaluable through various stages of the app design. I was able to identify a clear target market and managed to gain great insight from real potential users.<br><br>

It would be beneficial to continue this project by exploring the side of the app that would be necessary for food truck owners so they could set up their profile and add menu items. Perhaps the app would be able to pull information from Yelp and more easily fill the forms so truck owners wouldn’t necessarily have to do the heavy lifting.</p>
