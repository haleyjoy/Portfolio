        <p>In recent years, Generation X’ers and Millenials have flocked to cities like 
New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, etc, particularly due to the growth of the tech industry / start ups.  This clustering of young, trendy, work-minded individuals gave birth to another trend: Food Trucks.  Having experienced convenience-based dining in San Francisco, and admittedly having a notable sweet tooth, I designed Street Sweet, an app that helps Food Truck lovers find and order from their favorite sweet-themed Food Trucks.

        <p>I designed the Street Sweet app, produced user stories and flows, selected paired typefaces and a color palette, designed the logo, icon illustrations, wireframes and layouts, and produced a clickable prototype.

        <p>We’ve all been stuck in an office or classroom without enough time to go more than a few blocks during our lunch break.  My goal was to design an app that Enables food lovers to connect to their favorite nearby sweet-themed trucks, discover new trucks in their area, and order treats for pickup within the app.

        <h9>DISCOVERY/STRATEGY</h9>
        <p>There are plenty of food trucks out there, but for some of us, there is only one way to snack: SWEET!  After interviewing a few city-dwelling foodies and got the scoop on what features they might like to see in an app like this, I narrowed the focus of the project to sweet-themed food trucks only, and began considering what features to include.  Of course, before I could do this, I had to decide if I was going to explore the consumer experience, the food truck owner experience, or both.  I chose to focus solely the consumer side of how the app functions for this case study and design project.  
</p> <h9>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h9>
        <p>My focus group interviews helped me put together User Personas.  I wrote and prioritized user stories, which helped determine what features I’d build out.  The user flows I created from these stories allowed me to begin to determine what the navigation within the app might look like, as well as further narrow down which features would be most useful.  
</p>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img alt="user flows" src="images/streetsweet/userflows.png">
            </div>
         <p class="img-caption">User Flows</p>
        <p>I did a potential user survey to gain more insight into which features may be most useful.  One example was being able to add trucks to a “Favorites” list, and locate those trucks on a map from that “Favorites” page.  This feature became a much bigger priority after hearing survey feedback saying that would be very useful (many  survey takers prioritized this feature over being able to write a review.)<br><br>

I developed low fidelity wireframes using MyBalsamiq with my prioritized features list and user flows in mind.  I used these wireframes to create a clickable prototype using InVision so I could fill in the “gaps” in navigation when I moved on to high fidelity wireframes.  


</p>
        <div style="text-align: center"> <img alt="low fidelity wireframes" src="images/streetsweet/lowfi-wireframes.png"></div>
        <p class="img-caption">Low Fidelity Wireframes</p>
        <div style="text-align: center"> <img alt="high fidelity wireframes" src="images/streetsweet/highfi-wireframes.png"></div>
        <p class="img-caption">High Fidelity Wireframes</p>
        <p>After user testing a high fidelity clickable prototype, I realized certain more minute features weren’t as clear to first-time users as they could be.  For example, after a user logs in, the first screen that loads is the map of their current location.  But with users who had never seen the app before, this seemed like some sort of error they made in the prototype testing.  <br><br>
I realized it would be wise to add a one-time popup to let new users know this is the right page to be on.  I also made sure the option to confirm an order pickup was more clearly displayed as a banner above the menu bar throughout the app until clicked and completed- as users who didn’t perfectly follow the test instructions wound up astray and unable to find their way back to the confirm pick-up page.

        <p class="img-caption">Pop-Up and Banner</p>
        <h9>VISUAL DESIGN</h9>
        <p>After doing sketches, I narrowed my designs down to a food truck icon design with the name Street Sweet, or a “cupcake truck”.  
</p>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img alt="logo sketches" src="images/streetsweet/logosketches.png"></div>
        <p class="img-caption">Logo Sketches, Logo Iterations</p>
        <p>After fleshing out both options in Illustrator, the cupcake truck was clearly the winner.  I knew I would still be using my truck icon within the app, though.<br><br>

My color palette, wound up including several cool greys, instead of the deep maroon and mid-grey I initially chose. These changes were made as I worked on the HQ layouts and saw the colors in action, and after receiving survey feedback.  </p>
        <div style="text-align: center"><img alt="style guide" src="images/streetsweet/styleguide.png"></div>
        <p class="img-caption">Street Sweet Style Guide</p>
        <p>I chose typefaces at this point as well.  Chewy was my final choice for headlines, as it is a great combination 
of readable, playful, not overused, and still professional.  Nunito was my final choice for smaller headlines and paragraphs, because it has a friendly vibe while maintaining professionalism, and is easy to read when scaled down (ideal for iOS design).  I also designed custom icons for the menu bar that better suited the feeling of the app.<br><br>
While working on High Quality screen designs, I decided on popup styles, button styles, and more.  I wrote original copy and developed personas for the truck profile, reviews, etc. and developed a clickable prototype.  User testing proved that the changes included at the high fidelity mockup stage made the app easy to use from start to finish.</p><br><br><br>

        <p>Figuring out how Street Sweet would all function and flow was a great exercise in navigation / functionality within an app.  User testing proved to be an important part of the process as outside opinions were invaluable through various stages of the app design.  I was able to identify a clear target market and managed to gain great insight from real potential users.<br><br>

It would be beneficial to continue this project by exploring the side of the app that would be necessary for food truck owners, so they could set up their profile / add menu items in.  Perhaps the app would be able to pull information from Yelp and more easily fill the forms so trucks don’t necessarily have to do the heavy lifting.
