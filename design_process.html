             <br><h5>Heritage Design Process</h5>
            <p>At Heritage, our small team has developed a detailed design process.  Not all of these steps are required for each project, so I try to think of our design process as "tools in a toolbelt" that I can pull from as needed.  While they are listed here in a certain order, many of these parts of the process require revisiting during a project.  There are a few key steps that cannot be skipped or reordered, however, and each step must be handled intentionally and with care.
                
                <div class="centered"><img class="centered" alt="Design Process" src="images/heritage/designprocess.png"><p class="centered caption">Design Process</p></div>
             <p>Regardless of the project or goal, the most important way to start on a project is to drop my ego entirely.  The users I would be working on designing new tools for are world experts on their respective categories, so in order to design the most effective software, I need to learn about their processes and their unique needs.  The best solutions result when I pair my objective observations with empathy for the users, as well as my sharp design instincts and tools.</p>

    <div class="blue">

         <div class="row">
             <br><h5>Kickoff</h5>
             <p>The Kickoff meeting at the start of a project is crucial.  As a designer, this is your one opportunity to set the tone for the project.  Communicating the steps that will be taken throughout the lifespan of the project, determining the best communication style that will be most effective with stakeholders, setting expectations, determining goals, and nailing down the scope of a project.. All of these steps happen in the Kickoff meeting.<br>
             <h4>Overview</h4>
             To start the kickoff meeting, as a UX Designer on a small team with no Project Designer, this is my oppotunity to wear that hat and own the project.  I try to start off on the right foot by reviewing our design process so that everyone is on the same page.  A lot of the time, stakeholders who aren't accustomed to working with a design team don't know what to expect.  UX is not a made-to-order practice, there is thorough research involved, and a larger picture to consider when designing an interdepartmental application.  By being transparent about what stakeholders and users can expect from the design process, a designer has the opportunity to earn a certain level of professional respect, and set the tone moving forward.  Taking this opportunity to clearly spell out the roles of each team member involved will protect the designer from doing work that should be completed by a Project Manager, for example.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Hopes and Dreams</h4>
             Starting off discussions by asking the stakeholder(s) what all of their hopes and dreams are.  This doesn't have to be limited to the project at hand, so long as you're clear about it.  Similar to the start of the Double Diamond approach to design,  opening up the discussion this way gives stakeholders a chance to spell out all of their goals, desires, and even vent about their frustrations. By listening and observing during this phase, a designer can get a good feel for the communication style that might be most effective moving forward.  Often at this phase, the stakeholder will talk themselves out of off-the-wall requests that would be costly to build with minimal payoff, simply after seeing the design process laid out ahead of them.  This helps narrow down to the core issues that need to be addressed during the project.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Automation / Manual Work</h4>
             During discussion, I try to identify if there are processes that can be automated.  Most employees at Heritage have too much on their plates, and spend time working on repetitive, analog tasks that often take place on sticky notes or in spreadsheets.  Identifying and automating these processes helps minimize human error, record useful data for use company-wide, and naturally, give employees more time to focus on the more important tasks on their plate.
             
             <br><br><h4>Milestones</h4>
             Depending on the scale of the project, a threaded design approach may help.  If it's possible to implement smaller parts of a bigger solution, setting smaller milestones will get incremental improvements out for users faster, and will make for easier testing and adoption.  This can also help with setting stakeholder expectations.
             <br><br><h4>Scope</h4>
             Thinking back to the Hopes and Dreams phase, stakeholders had the chance to speak about everything they need the design team's help with.  In this phase, designers reign those ideas in and narrow down exactly what this project will consist of.  In my experience at Heritage Auctions, the demand for design work is very high, and split between a vast number of departments.  As designers, it is invaluable to put in effort to make sure stakeholders don't feel we will throw a solution out there, and disappear for years.  By reassuring stakeholders that the solution will be a living organism, and this is "just phase one", the designer ensures nobody will walk away from the kickoff meeting feeling they need to rush and squeeze in all of their requests at once.  It is important not to dismiss the ideas that won't be included in the scope of the project.  My approach at Heritage is to suggest the project manager involved should follow up with the stakeholder after the meeting and help set up Jira tickets to go on the Design Queue.  Since Jira sorts by business value and ROI, these projects will wind up in the correct place on the queue, and will receive attention when they are towards the top.<br>
             Once the stakeholders are satisfied with the agreement that there will be tickets for work to be done in the future, the project scope can be defined.
             <br><br><h4>Metrics</h4>
             In order to present a project's success to C-level managers, a designer should be prepared to discuss metrics.  When stakeholders define their goals, it become clearer what should be measured.  Some measurements can be done by getting together with a data developer and doing queries to discover bits of information.  However, not all measurements can be gathered behind the computer screen.  Some measurements, especially at the beginning of a project when solutions and potential automation haven't been implemented yet, require the designer to spend time in the field measuring and observing users as they complete their work.
             <br><br><h4>Goals</h4>
             Having stakeholders define their goals helps to determine what metrics would be the most useful, and helps prevent future scope creep.  While not all goals need to be numeric, it is invaluable for designers to be able to translate the goals of a manager to dollars and cents so they can effectively communicate in the proper language to C-level executives.

    <div class="container">
         <div class="row">
             <br><h5>Research</h5>
             <p>This stage of the Design Process should be spent mostly in the field with users, if possible.  At Heritage, we are fortunate to have our user base in just three buildings, all within 15 minutes of each other, so tracking down the right users is a simple task.  This is an opportunity to get developers involved and gather metrics, talk to users about their processes and needs, and really understand what their environment is like.  While the stakeholder's objectives helped define the project scope, observing and speaking with the end users will help shape the solution.
             <br>It should be noted that Heritage does not have a User Research specialist, so as a User Experience Designer there, I have had the opportunity to wear many hats and own the Design Process from beginning to end.  This includes User Research in and out of the field.<br>
             <h4>Data Metrics</h4>
             As previously mentioned, not all metrics can be gathered by a developer, but for the metrics that can, this phase involves sitting down and running queries to understand and record data that can be used to compare after a project has been implemented.<br>
             Understanding the data better will also help designers understand some of the technical constraints that may come up.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Interviews</h4>
             Speaking with both the stakeholder and the users is crucial to ensure a project's adoption and success.  Managers tend to be motivated by how much work their team is able to complete.  Users tend to be motivated by meeting the goals their manager has set for them, and feeling they are capable and equipped to do their work efficiently and with ease.  Balancing both these motives with the financial motives of executives is key.
             <br>
             Understanding what motivates, upsets, delights, and burdens the end users requires the designer to spend time asking the right questions, gaining insight into the individuals that will actually be using the solution at the end of the project.  Especially at Heritage, each team is entirely different, so getting a good handle on the personalities I'm designing for equips me to design better solutions.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Field Observation</h4>
             Spending as much time as can be allotted in the field builds rapport and reminds users that the designer is a service role.  While there are always technical limitations that can limit the potential solutions, and there are usually big-picture goals in the works that steer the project in a certain direction, observing the workflow of end users as they work naturally will shape the end solution.  Managers are often unaware of the issues that plague their employees, so designers benefit immensely seeing firsthand every post it note stuck to computer screens, every spreadsheet that holds isolated, stale data, and every time users have to run across the room to grab a sheet of paper from a pile on an unused desk.  An active designer will jump at the opportunity to question the employee's process and try to understand the cumbersome manual processes that can be digitized or automated for users.  While some processes must remain manual, there are ways a designer can take the "guesswork" off of their plate, and create a product that works seamlessly alongside their manual work.<br>This is also a great opportunity to record scenarios that can later be translated to Use Cases and, ideally, written into Code Tests.

             <br><h5>Ideation</h5>
             <p>This stage is for fleshing out use cases, recognizing patterns, diagramming the business rules and fleshing out wireframes.<br>
             <h4>Requests</h4>
             Between the kickoff meeting, user interviews, and field observation, there should be a fairly robust list of user requests written down by this phase.  The designer should at this point confirm that the requests are within project scope.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Use Cases</h4>
             Translating the requests to Use Cases creates a common language for Project Managers, Developers, Stakeholders, Users, and Designers to use when testing and discussing the project going forward.  These Use Cases should easily translate to Code Tests so developers can set themselves up for simpler testing in the future.  This is an organic document that will grow as needed, even after the solution has been adopted.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Business Logic</h4>
             This is a phase that likely gets visited at several points in time.  This phase means working with stakeholders to define the rules that will be implemented with the solution.  Designers should be prepared to ask questions based on some of their observations from doing field research.  Any rules that are decided on should be translated to Use Cases.
             <br><br><h4>Patterns</h4>
             With a robust Design Library at hand, designers can pull tools off the shelf to determine the product's workflow.  Using a design library saves on developer hours and helps to ensure a consistent experience application-wise, and across both Desktop and Mobile platforms.  At Heritage, our team tries to identify patterns across departments so users can quickly pick up new tools and solutions, as they are using tools they are already familiar with.
             <br><br><h4>Diagrams</h4>
             Documenting use cases and visually representing user flow is a quick way to discover holes in logic, or find patterns that were hard to recognize prior.  This can also lessen future bugs, as developers have an additional resource to refer to when they are working on programming the solution.
             <br><br><h4>Wireframes</h4>
             Creating simple wireframes equips developers with what the front end needs to look like, and gives stakeholders a good idea of what the solution will be.  While Heritage does not use tools to create a working wireframe prototype, tools like InVision can be used to imitate navigating through an application.  Designers can then run testing to see how users interact with the product, and iterate accordingly.

             <br><h5>Reviews</h5>
             <p>Since much of the Ideation process happens isolated from other team members, the next step is getting everyone back on the same page, and ensuring the designs are airtight.  This is a phase that will likely be revisited a handful of times, as iterations go back and forth between designers and stakeholders.
             <br>
             <h4>Design Team</h4>
             Getting together with fellow designers and going over the designs with a fine tooth comb is an important step.  Other designers may recognize patterns that had been overlooked, or notice that semantics aren't matching up with the projects they're working on that relate.  Having fresh eyes taking a look can also help point out missing information or logic holes that weren't so apparent at first.
             <br><br>
             <h4>User Testing</h4>
             Showing a prototype to the users and observing how they interact with it can shed light on their process, and help determine if the solution is in fact as solid as it can be.  While the stakeholder generally has the ultimate signoff, including the users in the testing process can help ease adoption down the road, and build a sense of camaraderie between the design team and the users.  
             <br><br>
             <h4>Stakeholder</h4>
             With the feedback from the users in hand, this step involves showing the stakeholder a prototype and explaining how it will meet their objectives.  By now, the designer likely understands the stakeholder's communication style.  The stakeholder may not approve the first "draft", but that's ok.  Oftentimes during the kickoff meeting and interviews, communication of what the stakeholder expects can be a little off.  It can be hard to explain exactly what one needs without seeing it right in front of them.  The outcome of this meeting should either be an agreement that the solution is ready for development, or a clearer understanding of what the stakeholder really needs.  As long as the channels of communication remain open and the designer knows what to do next, this stakeholder review is a success.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Development</h4>
             While these steps are listed in a certain order, this is a step that should be visited throughout the design process.  Developers are aware of limitations and how a solution is going to be built.  Keeping them in the loop and asking lots of questions about the design is likely to save design hours that could have to be spent rethinking the project down the road due to technical limitations they were unaware of.  Assuming the developers have been informed and aware throughout the design process, this meeting will allow them to move forward with a thorough understanding of what needs to be built.  Briefly going over the use cases can also be beneficial, as through the use cases, the designer has laid out a detailed clear plan of what is expected of the developers, and met the developers halfway on writing code tests.

             <br><h5>Alpha Testing</h5>
             <p>This is testing done within the IT department.  At Heritage, we don't have any QA team members, so this is done with developers, designers and project managers.
             <br>
             <h4>Code Tests</h4>
             Developers should sit down with the designer and show them that all of the code tests, based on the use cases, are passing without problems.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Integration Tests</h4>
             By hand, designers and project managers should use the QA version of the application to put the use cases to the test.  If everything passes, the designer can move on to beta test with users.  If the use cases do not pass, they need to walk through the use cases that are failing with the developers to see what needs to be fixed.

             <p>This is testing done in QA with the users and stakeholders.  This can also wind up sending a project back to Ideation if there are issues with ease of use.
             <br>
             <h4>Users</h4>
             The designer should have the users test the solution in QA.  The use cases give the meeting a "script" to follow, so having them run through these scenarios in the application will prevent users from approving without really testing the solution.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Stakeholder</h4>
             This step involves running through the use cases with the stakeholder and sharing how the users reacted to the testing.  If both user and stakeholder tests go smoothly, the project is ready for launch.  However, there may be improvements that can be made beforehand.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Usability</h4>
             If users navigate the tests with ease and seem to understand how to use the solution, then it has passed the usability test, and with stakeholder approval, can move on to production.  If there is confusion, strange workflow, or discomfort, usability likely needs improvement.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Engagement</h4>
             If the stakeholder is hard to get ahold of, but users have tested and seem comfortable with the solution, the solution will launch to production.

             <br><h5>Roll Out</h5>
             <p>To ensure successful adoption, the roll out of new features should be handled with care.  Necessary training should be held, and the stakeholder should make sure that all parties affected by the new product are aware of the impending launch.
             <br>
             <h4>Announcements</h4>
             Working with the stakeholder to communicate to all users affected by the new solution is important, especially since not all stakeholders are intentional and regular in their communication.  The more transparent the designer and stakeholder can be with users about the new product launch, the better.  
             <br><br>
             <h4>Training</h4>
             At Heritage, we have a full time trainer who works with users to ensure they are comfortable using new tools.  This step means holding a training with the users, the trainer, a project manager, a designer, and if they can make it, the stakeholder.
             <h4>Launch</h4>
             The solution is put in production for use.

             <br><h5>Follow Up</h5>
             <p>A lot can happen after a product is launched.  Not only should a designer follow up and be aware of the impact the solution has had, but they should also follow up about adoption and any issues users are having.
             <br>
             <h4>Data Metrics</h4>
             The measurable results that were decided on prior should be tracked after launch so a designer can communicate the impact of the project.  It is important to measure not only the numeric impact of a project, but the satisfaction and delight of the users affected.  Ideally, at Heritage, the solution has improved and streamlined their workflow significantly.
             <br><br>
             <h4>Field Observation</h4>
             Spending time with the users as they make use of the solution is important.  There will often be new, niche use cases that come out of this, as users can't always be expected to communicate every niche scenario they'll encounter until they actually experience it.  If there are new use cases, they can be considered in the next iteration of improvement.
             <h4>3 Week Review</h4>
             If no bugs have been reported, the designer should check in with the users and stakeholder after three weeks to see if things are still going smoothly.  Some personalities are less likely to report problems as they feel they're "complaining" or "bothering someone uneccessarily", so it's good to open up the forum and give them an opportunity to voice their concerns.  Hopefully, though, the "no news is good news" philosophy applies, and the users and stakeholders are delighted with the solution.<br>
             If the designer discovers that not all users have adopted the new product, this is a good opportunity to try and find out why.  If it's a training issue, a refresher can be scheduled with the trainer.  If it's a design issue, it can be discussed with the stakeholder and potentially send the project back to a prior step if need be.
             <br><br>
             <h4>3 Month Review</h4>
             Several months of usage will mean the users and stakeholder should be very familiar with the new tools they have been given.  At this point, they likely have lots of valuable feedback, and they may have dreamt up new further improvements.  Checking in at this point will also remind the team that the designer hasn't just disappeared on them, that there will be future iterations and opportunities to improve upon the tools provided.
