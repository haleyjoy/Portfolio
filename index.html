                    <p>Hi, I’m Haley Guilfoile!  I’m currently located in Dallas TX.  My work includes user research, user experience design, user interface design as well as graphic work, illustration, carving, painting, laser etching, etc.  I love taking on challenges and learning new techniques.  I work quickly, and think several steps ahead at all times.  <br>I am sunny, optimistic, and outgoing.  I love coffee, I probably eat too much sushi, I have a baby daughter, as well as a bearded dragon named Mango.  I am most motivated when I’m juggling several different tasks or projects, and I love working with a team, as well as working independently.<br><br> To read more about my skills and experience, click the icons below!</p></div>

                    <p>After completing my Bachelor’s degree in Illustration (focus on Digital Illustration) from Academy of Art University in San Francisco in May 2016, I went on to complete the Bloc UI/UX Web Design program.<br><br>While completing my undergraduate degree, I independently built a freelance and ecommerce brand through social media marketing and online sales.  I established brand presence within a niche online market and maintained excellent customer relations resulting in a ~75% repeat client base, generating both B2B and B2C sales, resulting in a gross profit of ~$50,000.  <br><br>I participated in two rounds of a collaborative Digital Publishing project resulting in published interactive magazines for iPad.  I assisted in copywriting, and conceptualized, illustrated, and executed interactive pieces for more than 10 articles.<br><br>I have a commissioned outdoor mural in San Francisco completed in Spring 2015, and I’ve been commissioned to plan and execute a mural in Austin, TX (Fall 2017).</p></div></div>

                    <div class = "one-half">
                    <p>I have a BFA in Illustration with a focus on Digital Art, and I’ve freelanced as an Illustrator for over 10 years.  
I have worked on projects with a variety of clients, including Samsung (Developers Conference), ReWaxation Spa, Peephole Magazine, Bamboo Asia Restaurant, Northville Baseball Association, etc.  While studying, I started with classical training using many mediums, including charcoal, watercolor, oil paint, and gouache.  With the Elements and Principles of Visual Design at the core of my education, I studied storytelling and communication through art.  Sculpture classes rounded out my classical training with the important ability to think in 3D while creating 2D artwork.  I use a Wacom tablet and Adobe CC.<br><br>

My Illustration portfolio can be viewed at <a href="http://www.lovenotestudios.com">www.lovenotestudios.com</a>.  I discuss the recent design overhaul of my portfolio website, and changes I made in my <a href="/lovenotestudios.html">Love Note Studios Case Study</a>.

                    <div class = "one-half">
                    <p>I chose to complete the Web Design program with Bloc Inc. so I could further utilize my strong design background and creativity.  My process includes user research, user surveys, content creation, low/high fidelity wireframing, prototyping, and user testing.  I believe that design should be approached with the user in mind at each step.  Interviews, surveys, and focus groups are important steps of the design process as they help refine the target user’s end goals.  After achieving a minimum viable product, I execute design improvements and changes to improve the user’s experience, and perfect the product.<br><br>

I have experience using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, and web apps including myBalsamiq and Invision to create rapid prototypes that work within design limitations and achieve company goals, while keeping the user at the heart of the process.

                    <div class = "one-half">
                    <p>Through experimentation, research, and plenty of practice, I learned to recarve and repaint dolls.  I discovered a niche market of collectors, and have been selling my custom dolls and artwork within this community since 2012.  With a primary focus on customizing and selling Blythe Dolls (big eyed dolls produced by Takara Tomy in Japan), I have expanded my skills in character creation beyond my illustration work.<br><br>Community involvement has been an important part of my independent artistry.  I was the featured illustrator of Blythecon Chicago, a nonprofit convention for United States Blythe Doll Collectors.  I served as a volunteer on the committee that planned, organized and executed the event in 2015.  I have also created and shared tutorials on doll customization.

                    <div class = "one-half">
                    <p>I’ve laser cut/etched a variety of materials including acrylic, wood, leather, etc. for varying projects.  In combination with other technologies and skillsets, such as shaping acrylic using a heat gun, sewing, riveting, etc., I’ve created sculptural fashion pieces with laser cut parts.  Producing 3D pieces from flat materials requires creative problem solving and detailed planning.  I have been commissioned to design and create high quality custom business cards cut from acrylic and wood and embellished with Swarovski crystals.  <br><br> Using primarily Epilog and Universal brand laser machines, the limitations of working with laser cut materials and thinking in 3D have certainly given my design skills new depth, and have opened my mind to innovative branding opportunities.

                    <p>As a single mother, I am a skilled multitasker.  Juggling six unrelated tasks is a normal day for me.  With limited time to get things done, I work quickly, without compromising quality results.  To say motherhood requires compassion and empathy would be an understatement.  Prior to having my daughter, I would have said creative problem solving was a strength of mine.  Now, it’s a necessity and a muscle I exercise 24/7! <br><br>  
My involvement in “mommy groups” and parenting activities has given me great knowledge of the family and baby markets, and another awesome focus group to pull from when doing user research.
