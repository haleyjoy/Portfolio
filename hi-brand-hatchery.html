    <div class="row"><br><p><p>I spent an embarrassing amount of time geeking out over the genius that makes up the Brand Hatchery portfolio.  I think my socks have been permanently knocked off.  It’s no wonder your team has been able to consistently deliver fantastic work.  You guys do the type of amazing work an artist/designer like myself can really get excited about.<br><br>
At Academy of Art University in San Francisco, I received a BFA in Digital Illustration and Interactive Artwork. The program began with classical training in many traditional mediums, including charcoal, watercolor, oil paint, and gouache.  Sculpture classes quite literally rounded out my artwork, providing me with the important ability to think in 3D while creating 2D work. CNC Laser Etching and 3D Printing classes gave me a deeper understanding of the incredible technologies that are rapidly changing the world. The Elements and Principles of Visual Design have greatly influenced my digital illustration as well. Since committing to a relationship long ago with Adobe Creative Suite, Photoshop and Illustrator have come to terms with having to share my attention, but don’t tell them about Sketch, with whom I have also have a long-standing relationship!  <br><br> 
I’ve freelanced as an illustrator for over 10 years, working with clients all over the globe. Through my Love Note Studios brand, I not only designed and produced products and illustrations for a niche market, but created customer experiences through unique packaging, storytelling and interaction, resulting in a 75% repeat customer base. ReWaxation Spa recently hired me to do a brand facelift. I redesigned their website, logo, and business cards; designed, planned and painted murals at locations in San Francisco, CA and Austin, TX; and designed and produced storefront window clings, t-shirts, customer loyalty cards, and custom spray tanning stickers. I even created an infographic to train new employees on the ReWAXation method of spray tanning. <br><br>
Passion and positivity feed my energy and creativity. Can’t is not a word in my vocabulary. When a task seems nearly impossible, or a deadline is tight, a switch flips in my head, and I generate some of my most innovative work. I love taking on new skills, learning new technology on the fly, and exuberantly diving into design projects head-first. I work even faster than the speed at which I eat mac and cheese, which, let me tell you, is lightning speed! And I am committed to fostering an enthusiastic and positive workplace, as the best collaboration happens when team members inspire and encourage one another.<br><br>
        I am a high-energy person who thrives in the company of other make-it-happen people. Yes, I have skills: UX/UI, illustration, visual storytelling, etc. But more importantly, I have creative talent and a curious and inventive mind that thinks out-of-box. I would be thrilled to put these skills and talents to work at The Brand Hatchery, where there is a relentless drive to “find, craft and broadcast” great brand stories.<br><br>
        Looking forward to hearing from you!<br><br>
