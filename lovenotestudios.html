             <br><h5>Project</h5><br>
             <p>I’ve had my website <a href="https://www.lovenotestudios.com/">www.lovenotestudios.com</a> since 2012. It serves as an online portfolio of my illustration work, custom dolls and toys, and laser cut work. I’ve done two overhauls to my site prior to this project. I knew how outdated my site was but I hadn’t taken it upon myself to redo it again. While taking the Bloc Web Design course, I was forced to confront my sad, cluttered, and embarrasing website. (Best read with a note of sarcasm, but the website was sad, cluttered and embarrassing!!) This was the most in-depth overhaul yet, and it was certainly for the best!</p>
             
         
        </div> </div><br><a name="myrole"></a>
    <div class="blue">
    <div class="container">
         <div class="row">
             <br><h5>My Role</h5><br>
            <p>I designed the logo, wrote the copy, reconfigured the navigation and site organization, cut down the number of pages throughout the site to less than a quarter of the original amount, redesigned each page, redid color scheme / font choices, etc.</p>
             
         
        </div> </div></div><br><a name="goal"></a>
    <div class="container">
         <div class="row">
             <br><h5>Goal</h5><br>
            <p>The goal of this design overhaul was to simplify the content and layout as much as possible, and let the artwork stand on it’s own without going overboard “showing it off”. Additional goals were simpler and more user-centered navigation, and a more concise design vocabulary throughout the whole website.</p>
             
         
        </div> </div><br><a name="process"></a>
    <div class="blue">
    <div class="container">
         <div class="row">
             <br><h5>Process</h5><br><h4>Discovery / Strategy</h4>
            <p>After getting feedback from many of my customers, I realized the navigation of my site was every bit as big of an issue as I thought it was. There was no navigation bar, so it took forever to get around the website, and I had a “back” button on every page (which is silly and pointless because there’s already a back button on your browser! *oops*). I also got feedback from a few very talented designers, who implored me to get rid of the handwritten part of my logo and use a font instead. I realized much of my site that I had originally considered “additional features” and “enhancements” were really getting in the way of the site’s functionality.</p>
             <div class="centered"><img class="centered" alt="old landing page" src="images/lovenotestudios/oldlandingpage.png">
                 <p class="centered caption">Old Landing Page + Logo</p></div><br>
             <p>I had links on my landing page to 14 different pages. That’s just absurd! I was able to narrow down the neccessary links to 5 main navigation bar links, with dropdown shortcuts to a total of 5 other pages. I limited the new site to these 10 pages- cut down from over 35 pages! The point of my site is to feature my work, to tell a bit about myself and my work experience, and to give people a way to contact me. After narrowing down the necessary pages and organizing navigation, I narrowed down the information needed on each page individually. I initially featured large scale illustrations on nearly every page of my site. I removed the majority of spot illustrations, and limited the links and copy significantly.</p><br>
             <h4>Visual Design</h4>
         <p>After deciding what needed to go on each page, I kept my designs as simple as possible. I redid my logo to use a font instead of handdrawn letters, I used a much more limited color palette, and kept things simple, bright and light. I let the focus on the home page be on one illustration rather than a bunch of illustrative buttons, and one blurb of text rather than several, some of which could be easily included in the “About Me” page instead.

             <div class="centered"><img class="centered" alt="new landing page" src="images/lovenotestudios/newlandingpage.png"><p class="centered caption">New Landing Page</p></div><br>
             <p>I realize it’s not for everyone, but I currently use Wix to host my Illustration site. I made the finishing changes to my new layout and published the results, and my customers are ecstatic.

             <br><h5>Results</h5><br>
            <p>I didn’t realize how much trouble they had before when trying to do just the most basic things my website is here for: accessing my art, my tutorials, information about me, and trying to contact me. I thought by having a bunch of extra features, I was making my portfolio site much more interesting and enticing- but that couldn’t have been less true! I was distracting site visitors from their goals, and making the website confusing and difficult to navigate. The new layout is straight to the point, and only contains the content that visitors to my site really need to see. Eventually I’d like to code it out and pry myself away from Wix, but for now the site meets my needs much better than it ever has.
