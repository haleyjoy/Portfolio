             <br><h5>Project</h5><br>
            <p>For over 20 years, Heritage Auctions catalogers made use of 20+ "legacy" applications, many of which were built for individual teams of just 2 or 3 employees to use.  With no central program to access data, employees scrambled between multiple different programs to handle simple tasks, simply lacking the proper tools to complete their work.  Teams throughout the company were constantly behind on deadlines due to cumbersome technology that took too long to use, and vital data was "stored" on sticky notes passed from desk to desk, and Excel spreadsheets with stale data, inaccessible to supervisors or executives.  A more robust, modern, and user friendly solution was sorely overdue.
             <br>
             Nexus is a permission-based centralized application designed to empower employees to handle their workload within one application, and not only meet deadlines, but exceed manager expectations.  Nexus includes tools that digitize processes that once scraped by on those sticky notes and Excel spreadsheets.  Not only are Catalogers using Nexus, but Client Services representatives, Operations Team Members, and Shipping Associates.  Outdated data and cumbersome workflows are replaced by live data, an alert system, an automated worklist, and more.  Using an updated management system, team leads and managers can save 10+ hours a week that were once spent writing stale data on whiteboards and divying up work.

             <br><h5>My Role</h5><br>
            <p>I took on the task of designing tools for Collectibles Catalogers across 16 different departments throughout the company, and facilitating their move from their legacy applications to Nexus to ensure adoption. My responsibilities included initial research and observation, stakeholder and user interviews, user case studies, wireframing, code test design, QA testing, stakeholder testing, training / launch, and followup.</p>

             <br><h5>Goal</h5><br>
            <p>Our goal is to empower all Heritage Auctions employees with newly designed tools in Nexus, effectively replacing the legacy applications, and see that all departments are regularly meeting their deadlines.  By automating much of their work, employees can focus on more important tasks and complete their work more quickly and effectively.  Happier employees delighted by their modern, robust tools will stay at Heritage Auctions longer, and produce higher quality work.</p>

             <br><h5>Heritage Design Process</h5>
            <p>At Heritage, our small team has developed a detailed design process.  Not all of these steps are required for each project, so I try to think of our design process as "tools in a toolbelt" that I can pull from as needed.  There are a few key steps that cannot be skipped, however, and each step must be handled with care.
                
                <div class="centered"><img class="centered" alt="Design Process" src="images/heritage/designprocess.png"><p class="centered caption">Design Process</p></div>
             <p>Regardless of the project or goal, the most important way to start on a project is to drop my ego entirely.  The users I would be working on designing new tools for are world experts on their respective categories, so in order to design the most effective software, I need to learn about their processes and their unique needs.  The best solutions result when I pair my objective observations with empathy for the users, as well as my sharp design instincts and tools.</p>
             <br><h4>Kickoff</h4>
             <p>The Kickoff meeting is crucial.  As a designer, this is your one opportunity to set the tone for the project.  Communicating the steps that will be taken throughout the lifespan of the project, determining the best communication style that will be most effective with stakeholders, setting expectations, determining goals, and nailing down the scope of a project.. All of these steps happen in the Kickoff meeting.</p>
             <b>Overview</b><p>
             To start the kickoff meeting, as a UX Designer on a small team with no Project Designer, this is my oppotunity to wear that hat and own the project.  I try to start off on the right foot by reviewing our design process so that everyone is on the same page.  A lot of the time, stakeholders who aren't accustomed to working with a design team don't know what to expect.  UX is not a made-to-order practice, there is thorough research involved, and a larger picture to consider when designing an interdepartmental application.  By being transparent about what stakeholders and users can expect from the design process, a designer has the opportunity to earn a certain level of professional respect, and set the tone moving forward.  Taking this opportunity to clearly spell out the roles of each team member involved will protect the designer from doing work that should be completed by a Project Manager, for example.

            With departments like US Coins, Sports Memorabilia, Collectible Comic Books, Luxury Real Estate, and more, each department has vastly different requirements, challenges, and business rules.  However, since Operations team members and Client Services representatives would also be accessing these pages, uniformity would be key to ensure that even those employees who arent industry experts, as well as newer employees still learning their way around Nexus, would be able to quickly identify key information with ease.</p>

             As a permissions-based program, Nexus provides the necessary data to employees, while still maintaining client privacy and security.  Employees see only the information they have the clearance to access, and only have the ability to add or edit data on the appropriate pages for their respective responsibilities.</p>  </p>
